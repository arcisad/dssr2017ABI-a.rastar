# Team Charter

## Vision:

We are trying to create a coupled model in which different functional models of the respiratory system work toghether in real time to simulate
the physiological behaviour of the respiratory system. This will lead to a novel type of ventilation heterogeneity index (biomarker) through which 
we could characterise asthma more efficiently and reliably. 

## Mission:

Three existing models (Ventilation, Gas mixing and FEV) are able to work separately, however their outcome could not be validated as physiologically reliable.
We managed to couple all three models and they can now work in real time. Acinar unit volumes from the ventilation model is fed to the FEV model and also flow from the same model 
is used at each time step as an input for the gas mixing maneuver. 

I would also like to translate the model into a visual format in this specific project in the course, where you canenter the required parameter
values in fields of a form and get the result by clicking a button.

## Success criteria

We need to be able to validate oue model results using actual patient data. We have access to spirometry measurements and we shoudl at least test
our model on 10 healthy and 10 asthmatic subjects and compare the results with their spirometry data. 

Plus, for this particular purpose, I have to test the final application to verify that the results match with the ones from the Fortran hard codes.

## Team agreement

We work beased on mutual respect and sharing ideas. All tam membrs should have their voice heard in the team. The team works based on brain storming 
through regular biweekly and some other intermittent meetings. We use online platforms such as Asana to manage our projects and tasks where we could communicate
and provide our opinions and feedback. We use SVN and more recently Git for our version controlling. 

The ownership of the intellectual property generated as the outcome of the projects remains in hands of the funding agency and the principal investigator. Any new outcome resulted from individual creativity which does not fall into the scope of the project, belongs to the creator. 

## Project team

The project team comprises supervisors, avisors and students. Supervisors are responsible for managing the project and guiding the students. 
Advisors provide constructive feedback and solutions for problems ahead over the course of the project. Students are the main deriving force
of the project who shoud work through the problems under their supervisors.
